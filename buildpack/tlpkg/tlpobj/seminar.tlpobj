longdesc A class that produces overhead slides (transparencies), with
longdesc many facilities. The class requires availability of the
longdesc fancybox package. Seminar is also the basis of other classes,
longdesc such as prosper. In fact, seminar is not nowadays reckoned a
longdesc good basis for a presentation -- users are advised to use more
longdesc recent classes such as powerdot or beamer, both of which are
longdesc tuned to 21st-century presentation styles. Note that the
longdesc seminar distribution relies on the xcomment package, which was
longdesc once part of the bundle, but now has a separate existence.
